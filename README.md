The 'core' of all Bixbi Addons, the creation of this script made it so I didn't have to remake functions on every single custom addon I make. For example it handles the notify format of scripts. <b>I do not recommend the renaming of this addon</b> as it will mess with my other scripts. Feel free to do so though if you want the extra work.
