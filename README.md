The 'core' of all Bixbi Addons, the creation of this script made it so I didn't have to remake functions on every single custom addon I make. For example it handles the notify format of scripts. <b>I do not recommend the renaming of this addon</b> as it will mess with my other scripts. Feel free to do so though if you want the extra work.

This script also has some customizable things to it, so please check the config. You may also want to disable/remove 'kb_client.lua' this is what I use for the handling of custom keybinds for all of the scripts on my server.
